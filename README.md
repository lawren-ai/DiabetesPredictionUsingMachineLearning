# DiabetesPredictionUsingMachineLearning

# ðŸ“– Project Overview
Diabetes mellitus remains a global health issue, causing thousands of deaths each day. Early detection of diabetes can help prevent severe health complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and vision loss. This project aims to develop a predictive model to detect potential diabetes cases using medical and demographic data.

# ðŸ’¾ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of diagnostic measurements related to diabetes, collected from a population of Pima Indian women. The dataset includes the following features:

**Feature** | **Type** | **Description**  |
